# Manipulation de graphes dirigés : transferts d’argent

University project part of the BA2 cursus in Computer Science at [ULB](http://www.ulb.ac.be/) (Course info-f-203)

Manipulates directed graphs (with cycles) and simplifies them to remove all cycles + minimize the number of edges.

## Applications

Persons could be represented as nodes, debts between them as edges and this program would output the easiest way to solve all debts.
